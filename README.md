1. I can write in the text field "Quoi de neuf ?" 
2. When I click on the button "Publier", I see a new post appear at the top of the list with the text I wrote and a random photo (*)
6. On the home page, I can scroll vertically to see all the posts

## Notes:
- API to use to get a random photo: https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev/random.json
Example of the API response:
```
{
  "file": "https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev/mVOd9yC1u3E_coffee.jpg"
}
```

- You don't need to save the posts in a database, just keep the information on the front-end
- You are encouraged to use Typescript
- To submit the project, you can send us the link of the project hosted on Github, Gitlab,... or a compressed file by mail
